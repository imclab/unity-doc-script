</signature>
Get the height used for a single Editor control such as a one-line EditorGUI.TextField or EditorGUI.Popup.
When creating your own multi-line controls, such as controls for custom classes with multiple fields, you can use [[EditorGULayout.GetControlRect]] and pass in a height value that is a multiple of [[EditorGUIUtility.singleLineHeight]]. This is advisable over hardcoding specific pixel values.
SA: [[EditorGUILayout.GetControlRect]].

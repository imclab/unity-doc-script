Generate online version of webplayer.
Generate HTML for the webplayer which references the Unity-hosted version of UnityObject2.js.  When this option is not used the HTML will reference a copy of UnityObject2.js which will be dropped into the build folder alongside the HTML.  This version of UnityObject2.js is easier to work with, and allows you to debug Javascript locally.

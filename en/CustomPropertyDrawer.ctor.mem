Tells a PropertyDrawer class which run-time class or attribute it's a drawer for.
When you make a custom drawer, you need put this attribute on the drawer class.

SA: [[PropertyDrawer]] class.
@param type If the drawer is for a custom [[Serializable]] class, the type should be that class. If the drawer is for script variables with a specific [[PropertyAttribute]], the type should be that attribute.
@param useForChildren If true, the drawer will be used for any children of the specified class unless they define their own drawer.

Raycast(Vector3,NavMeshHit)
</signature>
Trace a straight path towards a target postion in the NavMesh without moving the agent.
This function follows the path of a "ray" between the agent's
position and the specified target position. If an obstruction is 
encountered along the line then a true value is returned and
the position and other details of the obstructing object are stored
in the /hit/ parameter. This can be used to check if there is a clear
shot or line of sight between a character and a target object.
This function is preferable to the similar ::ref::Physics.Raycast
because the line tracing is performed in a simpler way using the navmesh and has a lower processing overhead.

BEGIN EX
var target: Transform;

	private var agent: NavMeshAgent;

	function Start () {
		agent = GetComponent.<NavMeshAgent>();
	}

	function Update() {
		var hit: NavMeshHit;
		
		// Note the negative test condition!
		if (!agent.Raycast(target.position, hit)) {
			// Target is "visible" from our position.
		}
	}
END EX
@param targetPosition The desired end position of movement.
@param hit Properties of the obstacle detected by the ray (if any).
@return True if there is an obstacle between the agent and the target position, otherwise false.

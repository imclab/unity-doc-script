Should the /connectedAnchor/ be calculated automatically?
If this is enabled, then the /connectedAnchor/ property will be calculated automatically to match the global position of the /anchor/ property. This is the default behavior. If this is disabled, you can configure the position of the connected anchor using the /connectedAnchor/ property.

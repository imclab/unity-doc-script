GetVector(string)
GetVector(int)
</signature>
Get a named vector value.
Four component vectors and colors are the same in Unity shaders. /GetVector/ does exactly the same
as ::ref::GetColor just the input data type is different (@@xyzw@@ in the vector becomes @@rgba@@ in the color).

SA: ::ref::GetColor, ::ref::SetVector, Shader::ref::PropertyToID.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	print(renderer.material.GetVector("_Color"));
END EX

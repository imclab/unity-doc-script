Switches the screen resolution.
A /width/ by /height/ resolution will be used.
If no matching resolution is supported, the closest one will be used.

If /preferredRefreshRate/ is 0 (default) Unity will switch to the highest refresh rate supported by the monitor.\\
If /preferredRefreshRate/ is not 0 Unity will use it if the monitor supports it, otherwise will choose
the highest supported one.

In the web player you may only switch resolutions after the user has clicked on the content.
The recommended way of doing it is to switch resolutions only when the user clicks on a designated button.

On Android /fullscreen/ controls the SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE flag to View.setSystemUiVisibility(), on
devices running Honeycomb (OS 3.0 / API 11) or later.

On Windows Store Apps, switching to non-native resolution is only supported starting from Windows 8.1 and newer.

A resolution switch does not happen immediately; it will actually happen when the current frame is finished.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Switch to 640 x 480 fullscreen

	Screen.SetResolution (640, 480, true);

Another example:
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Switch to 640 x 480 fullscreen at 60 hz

	Screen.SetResolution (640, 480, true, 60);
END EX
Another example:
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Switch to 800 x 600 windowed

limits
</signature>
Limit of angular rotation on the hinge joint.
The joint will be limited so that the angle is always between /limits.min/ and /limits.max/.
The joint angle is in degrees relative to the rest angle. The rest angle between the bodies is always zero at the beginning of the simulation.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Make hinge limit for a door.
	var limits = hingeJoint.limits;
	limits.min = 0;
	limits.minBounce = 0;
	limits.max = 90;
	limits.maxBounce = 0;
	hingeJoint.limits = limits;

GetRayIntersection(Ray,float,int)
</signature>
Cast a 3D ray against the colliders in the scene returning the first collider along the ray.
This is useful for finding colliders intersecting an arbitrary 3D ray.

Note that this function will allocate memory for the returned RaycastHit2D object. You can use ::ref::GetRayIntersectionNonAlloc to avoid this overhead if you need to make such calls frequently.

Additionally that this function is a 3D intersection test therefore any collision normals returned in the RaycastHit2D will be zero.
@param ray The 3D ray defining origin and direction to test.
@param distance Maximum distance over which to cast the ray.
@param layerMask Filter to detect colliders only on certain layers.

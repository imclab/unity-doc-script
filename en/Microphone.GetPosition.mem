GetPosition(string)
</signature>
Get the position in samples of the recording.
If you pass a null or empty string for the device name then the default microphone will be used. You can get a list of available microphone devices from the ::ref::devices property.

You can use this to control latency. If you want a 30ms latency, poll getRecordPosition() until 30ms (in samples) has gone and then start the audio.
@param deviceName The name of the device.

sleepVelocity

The default linear velocity, below which objects start going to sleep (default 0.15). Must be positive.

This value can be overridden per rigidbody using Rigidbody.sleepVelocity. 

This value is usually changed in @@Edit->Project Settings->Physics@@ inspector instead of from scripts.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	Physics.sleepVelocity = 0.1;
END EX

Build a development version of the player.
A development build includes debug symbols and enablesthe  [[Profiler]]. (To profile a webplayer you need to have the development version of the web player installed.  The unity3d file can be profiled only when the development webplayer is active.)

Note that a development build of a webplayer means that the unity3d file created is not LZMA compressed.

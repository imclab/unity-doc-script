Should this obstacle make a cut-out in the navmesh.
When enabled, this changes the navmesh by cutting out a hole. The shape of the hole is based on the bounding volume of the [[NavMeshObstacle]] and the navmesh bake settings for radius and height.

When the obstacle moves, the carved hole will also move but to reduce CPU overhead the hole is only recalculated when the obstacle is a certain distance from its previous position.- the ::ref::carvingMoveThreshold property sets this distance.

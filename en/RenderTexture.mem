Render textures are textures that can be rendered to.
They can be used to implement image based rendering effects, dynamic shadows,
projectors, reflections or surveillance cameras.

All rendering goes into the active RenderTexture (::ref::active class property).
If the active RenderTexture is /null/ everything is rendered to the main window.

For short-lived temporary render textures, use ::ref::GetTemporary and ::ref::ReleaseTemporary
functions. These are most often useful in image post processing effects.

Note that while [[wiki:class-RenderTexture|RenderTexture assets]] can be only power-of-two
size, it is possible to create a non-power-of-two render textures from scripts.
These are most often used for image post processing effects.

Keep in mind that render texture contents can become "lost" on certain events, like loading
a new level, system going to a screensaver mode, in and our of fullscreen and so on.
When that happens, your existing render textures will become "not yet created" again,
you can check for that with ::ref::IsCreated function.

RenderTexture class is only available in __Unity Pro__.

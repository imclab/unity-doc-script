SetPath(int,Vector2[])
</signature>
Define a path by its constituent points.
A ''path'' is cyclic sequence of line segments between points that define the outline of the polygon. Since the polygon can have holes and discontinuous parts, its shape is not necessarily defined by a single path.

SA: ::ref::pathCount, ::ref::GetPath.
@param index Index of the path to set.
@param points Points that define the path.

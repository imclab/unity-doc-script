The local active state of this GameObject. (RO)
This returns the local active state of this GameObject, which is set using [[GameObject.SetActive]].
Note that a GameObject may be inactive because a parent is not active, even if this returns true. This 
state will then be used once all parents are active. Use
[[GameObject.activeInHierarchy]] if you want to check if the GameObject is actually treated as
active in the scene.

SA: [[GameObject.SetActive]], [[GameObject.activeInHierarchy]].

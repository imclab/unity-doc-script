error
</signature>
Returns an error message if there was an error during the download (RO).
If there was no error, /error/ will return /null/ or an empty string (this is because some platforms don't allow nulls for string values). We recommend that you use String.IsNullOrEmpty to check for the presence of an error so that both cases are covered.

If the object has not finished downloading the data, it will block until the download has finished.
Use ::ref::isDone or /yield/ to see if the data is available.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Get a texture with an invalid url
	var url = "invalid_url";
	function Start () {
	     // Start a download of the given URL
	    var www : WWW = new WWW (url);

	    // Wait for download to complete
	    yield www;

	    // Print the error to the console
	    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(www.error))
	    	Debug.Log(www.error);

	    // assign texture
	    renderer.material.mainTexture = www.texture;
	}

deltaTime

Amount of time that has passed since the last recorded change in Touch values.
Values for the various touch properties are updated periodically. The deltaTime value is simply the amount of time that elapsed between the previous update and the current one. This is primarily useful for determining the movement speed of the touch position with reference to ::ref::deltaPosition.

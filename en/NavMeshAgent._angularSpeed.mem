Maximum turning speed in (deg/s) while following a path.
This is the maximum rate at which the agent can turn as it rounds the "corner" defined by a waypoint. The actual turning circle is also influenced by the speed of the agent on approach and also the maximum acceleration.

SA: acceleration, velocity.

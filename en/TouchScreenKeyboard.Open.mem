Opens the native keyboard provided by OS on the screen.
The /autocorrection/ determines whether the input tracks unknown words
and suggests a more suitable replacement candidate to the user,
replacing the typed text automatically unless the user explicitly
overrides the action.
The /multiline/ determines if user can input more than one line of
text.
The /secure/ identifies whether the keyboard is used for password. Text
in the input field will be hidden from the user except the recently
typed character.
The keyboard can be opened in the /alert/ mode too.
The /placeholder/ string will be displayed when there is no other text
in the input field of the keyboard.

	var inputURL : String = "http://www.unity3d.com";

	// Opens native keyboard optimized for URL entry
	function OnGUI() {

			keyboard = TouchScreenKeyboard.Open(inputURL, TouchScreenKeyboardType.URL);

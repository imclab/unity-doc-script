feetSpacing
</signature>
Modification to the minimum distance between the feet of a humanoid model.
When a humanoid model has unusually large feet (a cartoon-like character, say) the meshes for the feet can sometimes interpenetrate during IK movement. The default value for /feetSpacing/ is zero, but using a larger value will increase the minimum distance that is maintained between the feet and avoid interpenetration.

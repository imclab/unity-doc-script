GetPath(int)
</signature>
Get a path from the polygon by its index.
A ''path'' is cyclic sequence of line segments between points that define the outline of the polygon. Since the polygon can have holes and discontinuous parts, its shape is not necessarily defined by a single path.

The returned value is an ordered array of the points in the path.

SA: ::ref::pathCount, ::ref::SetPath.
@param index The index of the path to retrieve.

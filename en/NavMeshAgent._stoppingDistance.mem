stoppingDistance
</signature>
Stop within this distance from the target position.
It is seldom possible to land ''exactly'' at the target point, so this property can be used to set an acceptable radius within which the agent should stop. A larger stopping distance will give the agent more room for manoeuvre at the end of the path and might avoid sudden braking, turning or other unconvincing AI behaviour.

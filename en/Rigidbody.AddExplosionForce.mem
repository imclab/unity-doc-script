Applies a force to the rigidbody that simulates explosion effects. The explosion force will fall off linearly with distance to the rigidbody.
The function also plays nicely with ragdolls.

If /radius/ is 0, the full force will be applied no matter how far away /position/ is from the rigidbody.
/upwardsModifier/ applies the force as if it was applied from beneath the object.
This is useful since explosions that throw things up instead of pushing things to the side look cooler.
A value of 2 will apply a force as if it is applied from 2 meters below while not changing the actual explosion position.
/explosionPosition/	is the position from which the explosion force is to be applied.
/explosionRadius/ is the radius of the explosion. Rigidbodies further away than /explosionRadius/ will not be affected.

BEGIN EX
	var radius = 5.0;
	var power = 10.0;
	function Start () {
		// Applies an explosion force to all nearby rigidbodies
		var explosionPos : Vector3 = transform.position;
		var colliders : Collider[] = Physics.OverlapSphere (explosionPos, radius);
		
		for (var hit : Collider in colliders) {
			if (hit && hit.rigidbody)
				hit.rigidbody.AddExplosionForce(power, explosionPos, radius, 3.0);

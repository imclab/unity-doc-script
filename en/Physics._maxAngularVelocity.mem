maxAngularVelocity
</signature>
The default maximum angular velocity permitted for any rigid bodies (default 7). Must be positive.
The angular velocity of rigidbodies is clamped to maxAngularVelocity to avoid numerical instability with fast rotating bodies.
Because this may prevent intentional fast rotations on objects such as wheels, you can override this value per rigidbody using [[Rigidbody.maxAngularVelocity]].

This value is usually changed in @@Edit->Project Settings->Physics@@ inspector instead of from scripts.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	Physics.maxAngularVelocity = 10;
END EX

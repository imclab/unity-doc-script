Return a list of available devices.
This queries the system for the list of devices connected and it can be slow.
You should cache this value by keeping a copy of the result if you want to use it repeatedly.

BEGIN EX
	// Gets the list of devices and prints them to the console.
	function Start () {
		var devices : WebCamDevice[] = WebCamTexture.devices;
		for( var i = 0 ; i < devices.length ; i++ )
			Debug.Log(devices[i].name);

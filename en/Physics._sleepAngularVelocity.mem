sleepAngularVelocity
</signature>
The default angular velocity, below which objects start sleeping (default 0.14). Must be positive.
See [[wiki:comp:RigidbodySleeping|Rigidbody Sleeping]] for more information.
This can be overridden per rigidbody using Rigidbody.sleepAngularVelocity. 

This value is usually changed in @@Edit->Project Settings->Physics@@ inspector instead of from scripts.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	Physics.sleepAngularVelocity = 0.1;
END EX

A 2D Rectangle defined by x, y position and width, height.
The /Rect/ structure is mainly used for 2D operations. The UnityGUI system uses it extensively and it is also to set the onscreen position of a Camera's view.

The rectangle can be specified in two different ways. The first way involves supplying the top-left corner coordinate along with the width and height. This is done using the ::ref::x, ::ref::y, ::ref::width and ::ref::height properties.

The second way to specify the rectangle is to supply the X coordinates of its left and right sides and the Y coordinates of its top and bottom sides. These are denoted by the ::ref::xMin, ::ref::xMax, ::ref::yMin and ::ref::yMax properties.

Although the ::ref::x and ::ref::y properties may seem to be the same as ::ref::xMin and ::ref::xMax, their behaviour is actually slightly different. The /x/ and /y/ values are assumed to be used along with /width/ and /height/. This means that if you change /x/ or /y/ without changing /width/ or /height/ then the rectangle will change position but stay the same size. On the other hand, if you change the values of /xMin/ or /yMin/ without changing /xMax/ or /yMax/ then the rectangle will change size and the top-left corner will also change.

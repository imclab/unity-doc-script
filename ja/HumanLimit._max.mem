The maximum rotation away from the initial value that this muscle can apply.
The ::ref::center property specifies the rotation of the bone when the muscle is at "rest". The /max/ value specfies the maximum rotation in degrees away from the rest value that the muscle can apply. The ::ref::min value specifies a similar limit but in the negative direction of rotation.

The allowed range for the maximum is 0..180 degrees.

isOnOffMeshLink
</signature>
Is the agent currently positioned on an OffMeshLink? (RO)
This property is used when ::ref::autoTraverseOffMeshLink is false and the script is making its own decision about letting the agent cross the link.

See ::ref::CompleteOffMeshLInk for an example that uses this property to allow only certain agents to cross a link.

MarkNonReadable()
</signature>
Marks WebCamTexture as unreadable (no GetPixel* functions will be available (iOS only)).
This might allow unity to do some optimizations. On the other hand, as we skip almost all processing of WebCam data, you need to check videoVerticallyMirrored property for possible mirroring.

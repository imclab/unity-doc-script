deltaPosition
</signature>
The position delta since last change.
The absolute position of the touch is recorded periodically and available in the ::ref::position property. The deltaPosition value is a Vector2 that represents the difference between the touch position recorded on the most recent update and that recorded on the previous update. The ::ref::deltaTime value gives the time that elapsed between the previous and current updates; you can calculate the touch's speed of motion by dividing deltaPosition.magnitude by deltaTime.

SA: deltaTime.

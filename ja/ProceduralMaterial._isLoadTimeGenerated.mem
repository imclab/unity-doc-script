Should the ProceduralMaterial be generated at load time?
If enabled, the ProceduralMaterial will be generated when the scene loads.
If disabled, the ProceduralMaterial will not be generated until RebuildTextures or RebuildTexturesImmediately is called.

SA: ::ref::RebuildTextures, ::ref::RebuildTexturesImmediately.

Creates a new RenderTexture object.
The render texture is created with /width/ by /height/ size, with a depth buffer
of /depth/ bits (depth can be 0, 16 or 24), and in /format/ format and with sRGB read / write on or off.

Note that constructing a RenderTexture object does not create the hardware representation immediately.
The actual render texture is created upon first use or when ::ref::Create is called manually. So after
constructing the render texture, it is possible to set additional variables, like ::ref::format,
::ref::isCubemap and so on.

SA: ::ref::format variable, ::ref::GetTemporary.

@param width Texture width in pixels.
@param height Texture height in pixels.
@param depth Number of bits in depth buffer.
@param format Data format for the pixel information.
@param readWrite Is reading and writing of pixel data enabled?

Creates a new RenderTexture object.
The render texture is created with /width/ by /height/ size, with a depth buffer
of /depth/ bits (depth can be 0, 16 or 24). The render texture is set to be
in [[RenderTextureFormat.Default|color format]] by default.

Sleep()
</signature>
Make the rigidbody "sleep".
''Sleeping'' is an optimisation that is used to temporarily remove an object from physics simulation when it is at rest. This function makes the rigidbody sleep - it is sometimes desirable to enable this manually rather than allowing automatic sleeping with the ''sleepMode'' property.

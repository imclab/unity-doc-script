RequiredBone(int)
</signature>
Is the bone a member of the minimal set of bones that Mecanim requires for a human model?
The indexing order of the bones is the same as that used for the ::ref::BoneName array.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
function Start() {
	var boneName: String[] = HumanTrait.BoneName;
	
	for (var i = 0; i < HumanTrait.BoneCount; i++) {
		if(HumanTrait.RequiredBone(i))
			Debug.Log(boneName[i]);
	}
}
END EX
@param i Index of the bone to test.

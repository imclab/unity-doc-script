FindObjectOfType(Type)
</signature>
Returns the first active loaded object of Type /type/.
Please note that this function is very slow. It is not recommended to use this function every frame.
In most cases you can use the singleton pattern instead.

SA: Object.FindObjectsOfType.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
// Search for any object of Type GUITexture, 
// if found print its name, else print a message
// that says that it was not found.
function Start() {
  var texture : GUITexture = FindObjectOfType(GUITexture);
  if(texture)
    Debug.Log("GUITexture object found: " + texture.name);
  else
    Debug.Log("No GUITexture object could be found");
}
END EX

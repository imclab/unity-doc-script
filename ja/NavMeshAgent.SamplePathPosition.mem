SamplePathPosition(int,float,NavMeshHit)
</signature>
Sample a position along the current path.
This function looks ahead a specified distance along the current path. Details of the mesh at that position are then returned in a ::ref::NavMeshHit object. This could be used, for example, to check the type of surface that lies ahead before the character gets there - a character could raise his gun above his head if he is about to wade through water, say.

@param passableMask A mask specifying which NavMesh layers can be passed when tracing the path.
@param maxDistance Terminate scanning the path at this distance.
@param hit Holds the properties of the resulting location.
@return True if terminated before reaching the position at maxDistance, false otherwise.

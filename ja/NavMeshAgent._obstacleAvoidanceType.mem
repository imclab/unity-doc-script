obstacleAvoidanceType
</signature>
The level of quality of avoidance.
This property lets you trade off the precision of obstacle avoidance againt the processor load required to achieve it. The exact quality/performance values will depend heavily on the complexity of the scene but as a general rule, faster performance can be achieved at the cost of quality and vice versa.

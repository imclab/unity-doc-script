Start(string,bool,int,int)

Start Recording with device.
If you pass a null or empty string for the device name then the default microphone will be used. You can get a list of available microphone devices from the ::ref::devices property. You can find the range of sample rates supported by a microphone using the ::ref::GetDeviceCaps property.

Note that if you want to use the Microphone class in the web player, you need to get the
user's permission to do so. Call Application::ref::RequestUserAuthorization before calling
any Microphone methods.

rotationRateUnbiased
</signature>
デバイスのジャイロスコープで測定されたバイアスなし回転率を返す
Returns unbiased rotation rate as measured by the device's gyroscope.
The rotation rate is given as a Vector3 representing the speed of rotation around each of the three
 axes in radians per second. This value has been processed to remove "bias" and give a more accurate
 measurement. The raw value reported by the gyroscope hardware can be obtained with the
 ::ref::rotationRate property.

BEGIN EX
	var shakeSpeed: float;
	var shakeSound: AudioClip;

	function Update() {
		// Play a sound when the user rotates the device quickly.
		if ((Input.gyro.rotationRateUnbiased.y > shakeSpeed) && !audio.isPlaying) {
			audio.PlayOneShot(shakeSound);
		}
	}

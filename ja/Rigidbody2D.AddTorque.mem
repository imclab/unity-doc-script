AddTorque(float)
</signature>
Apply a torque at the rigidbody's centre of mass.
A torque is conceptually a force being applied at the end of an imaginary lever, with the fulcrum at the centre of mass. A torque of five units could thus be equivalent to a force of five units pushing on the end of a lever one unit long, or a force of one unit on a lever five units long. Unity's units are arbitrary but the principle that ''torque = force x lever length'' still applies.

Note that unlike a 3D Rigidbody, a Rigidbody2D can only rotate in one axis and so torque is a float value rather than a vector.

Apply(MaterialProperty)
</signature>
Apply extra initial values to the material.
This function is called in all property drawers when a new material is created, or a shader is changed on an existing material. This lets the property drawers apply any extra values to the materials, for example to setup shader keywords.

Note that if you change a property by assigning a value to it, Apply() is not called automatically. If you have any extra setup you need it to do, you should call it yourself.

@param prop The [[MaterialProperty]] to apply values for.

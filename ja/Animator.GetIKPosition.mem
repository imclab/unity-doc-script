GetIKPosition(AvatarIKGoal)

Gets the position of an IK goal.
An IK goal is a target position and rotation for a specific body part. Unity can calculate how to move the part toward the target from the starting point (ie, the current position and rotation obtained from the animation).

This function gets the current position of the specified goal in world space.

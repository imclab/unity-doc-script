acceleration
</signature>
The maximum acceleration of an agent as it follows a path, given in units / sec^2.
An agent does not follow precisely the line segments of the path calculated by the navigation system but rather uses the waypoints along the path as intermediate destinations. This value is the maximum amount by which the agent can accelerate while moving towards the next waypoint.

Plays animation without any blending.
Play() will start animation with name /animation/, or play the default animation.
The animation will be played abruptly without any blending.

If mode is PlayMode.StopSameLayer then all animations in the same layer will be stopped.
If mode is PlayMode.StopAll then all animations currently playing will be stopped.

If the animation is already playing, other animations will be stopped but the animation
will not rewind to the beginning.

If the animation is not set to be looping it will be stopped and rewinded after playing.

Play() will return false if animation can't be played (no animation clip or no default animation).
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Plays the default animation
	animation.Play();
END EX
For a specific animation, you can call the animation with play as well.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Plays the walk animation - stops all other animations in the same layer
	animation.Play("walk");
	// Plays the walk animation - stops all other animations
	animation.Play("walk", PlayMode.StopAll);
END EX

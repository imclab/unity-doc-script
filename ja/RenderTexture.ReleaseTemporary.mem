ReleaseTemporary(RenderTexture)
</signature>
Release a temporary texture allocated with ::ref::GetTemporary.
Later calls to ::ref::GetTemporary will reuse the RenderTexture created earlier if possible.
When no one has requested the temporary RenderTexture for a few frames it will be destroyed.

SA: ::ref::GetTemporary function.

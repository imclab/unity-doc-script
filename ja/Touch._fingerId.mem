fingerId
</signature>
The unique index for the touch.
All current touches are reported in the Input::ref::touches array or by using the Input::ref::GetTouch function with the equivalent array index. However, the array index is not guaranteed to be the same from one frame to the next. The /fingerID/ value, however, consistently refers to the same touch across frames. This ID value is very useful when analysing gestures and is more reliable than identifying fingers by their proximity to previous position, etc.

AddForce(Vector2)
</signature>
Apply a force to the rigidbody.
The force is specified as two separate components in the X and Y directions (there is no Z direction in 2D physics). The object will be accelerated by the force according to the law ''force = mass x acceleration'' - the larger the mass, the greater the force required to accelerate to a given speed.

SA: ::ref::AddForceAtPosition, ::ref::AddTorque, ::ref::mass, ::ref::velocity, Rigidbody::ref::AddForce.
@param force Components of the force in the X and Y axes.

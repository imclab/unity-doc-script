constraints
</signature>
Controls which degrees of freedom are allowed for the simulation of this Rigidbody.
By default this is set to RigidbodyConstraints.None, allowing rotation and movement along all axes.
In some cases, you may want to constrain a Rigidbody to only move or rotate along some axes, for 
example when developing 2D games. You can use the bitwise OR operator to combine multiple
constraints.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
// Freeze the rotation around x-Axis
rigidbody.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationX | RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationY;
END EX

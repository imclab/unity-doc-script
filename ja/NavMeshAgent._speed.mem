speed
</signature>
Maximum movement speed when following a path.
An agent will typically need to speed up and slow down as it follows a path (eg, it will slow down to make a tight turn). The speed is often limited by the length of a path segment and the time taken to accelerate and brake, but the speed will not exceed the value set by this property even on a long, straight path.

path
</signature>
Property to get and set the current path.
This property can be useful for GUI, debugging and other purposes to get the points of the path calculated by the navigation system. Additionally, a path created from user code can be set for the agent to follow in the usual way. An example of this might be a patrol route designed for coverage rather than optimal distance between two points.

Should this rigidbody be taken out of physics control?
If this property is set to true then the rigidbody will stop reacting to collisions and applied forces. This can be useful when an object should usually be controlled "kinematically" (ie, non-physically) but then sometimes needs physics for realism. For example, a human character is usually not implemented using physics but may sometimes be thrown through the air and collide with objects as the result of an impact or explosion.

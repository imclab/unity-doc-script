dampingRatio
</signature>
The amount by which the spring force is reduced in proportion to the movement speed.
The spring will oscillate with a certain frequency as it attempts to reestablish the desired distance between the objects. The higher the damping ratio, the quicker the oscillation will die down to zero.

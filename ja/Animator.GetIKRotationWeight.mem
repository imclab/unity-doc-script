GetIKRotationWeight(AvatarIKGoal)
</signature>
Gets the rotational weight of an IK goal (0 = rotation before IK, 1 = rotation at the IK goal).
An IK goal is a target position and rotation for a specific body part. Unity can calculate how to move the part toward the target from the starting point (ie, the current position and rotation obtained from the animation).

The rotation calculated by the IK is also influenced by a weight value in the range 0..1 that determines how far between the start and the goal to aim. This function returns the current weight value for the rotation of the goal.

@param goal The AvatarIKGoal that is queried.

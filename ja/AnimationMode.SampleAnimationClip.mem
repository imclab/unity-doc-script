SampleAnimationClip(GameObject,AnimationClip,float)
</signature>
Samples an AnimationClip on the object and also records any modified properties in AnimationMode.
This function must always be surrounded by AnimationMode.BeginSample and AnimationMode.EndSample. When a property is no longer sampled (through SampleAnimationClip or AddPropertyModification) between BeginSample and EndSample it will automatically revert to the original value when EndSample is called.

AnimationMode.BeginSample ();
AnimationMode.SampleAnimationClip (gameObject, clip, 0.3F);
AnimationMode.EndSample ();

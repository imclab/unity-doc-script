Stores and accesses player preferences between game sessions.
__Editor/Standalone__

On Mac OS X PlayerPrefs are stored in ~/Library/Preferences folder,
in a file named unity.[company name].[product name].plist, where company and product names are the names set up in Project Settings.
The same .plist file is used for both Projects run in the Editor and
standalone players.

On Windows, PlayerPrefs are stored in the registry under
HKCU\Software\[company name]\[product name] key, where company and product names are
the names set up in Project Settings.

On Linux, PlayerPrefs can be found in ~/.config/unity3d/[CompanyName]/[ProductName] again using the company and product names specified in the Project Settings.


__WebPlayer__

On Web players, PlayerPrefs are stored in binary files in the following locations:

__Mac OS X:__ ~/Library/Preferences/Unity/WebPlayerPrefs

__Windows:__ %APPDATA%\Unity\WebPlayerPrefs

There is one preference file per Web player URL
and the file size is limited to 1 megabyte. If this limit is exceeded, SetInt, SetFloat and SetString
will not store the value and throw a [[PlayerPrefsException]].

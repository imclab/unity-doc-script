angularVelocity
</signature>
Angular velocity in degrees per second.
Unlike a 3D Rigidbody, a Rigidbody2D can only rotate around one axis (perpendicular to the plane) so the angular velocity is just a float value rather than a vector. Typically, the value of this property is not set directly but rather by applying /torques/ to the rigidbody. The angular velocity will also decrease automatically under the effect of ''angular drag''.
